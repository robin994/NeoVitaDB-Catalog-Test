"""Build the on-device catalog from apps/*.json.

For every entry this resolves the latest GitHub release, picks the asset, and
derives the fields the app cannot compute for itself: version, date, size,
download count, the MD5 checksums used for update detection, a like count
from the repository's star count, and a trust flag from trusted_authors.json.

The output format is dictated by the on-device parser, which is not a JSON
parser: get_value_from_json() in source/database.cpp walks the text with strstr
looking for `"key": "` and cuts at the next quote. So the key order below is
load-bearing, every value is a string, and two fields have reserved
terminators. See FIELD_ORDER and emit_entry.
